## Added Features
Allows you to stop Minecraft without crashing it. Type .stop to acivate it (time is in seconds)
Also allows you to change the title of a book with .title<title>.

This is my first pull request ever, I hope I did everything right.
Also this is just a test. I already started to program more complex and better features for the client :D

## Note about Pull Requests

If you are contributing multiple unrelated features, please create a separate pull request for each feature. Squeezing everything into one giant pull request makes it very difficult for us to add your features, as we have to test, validate and add them one by one.

Thank you for your understanding - and thanks again for taking the time to contribute!!
