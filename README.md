If you speak both English and some other language, please help us by translating Wurst or reviewing existing translations. The translation files are located [here](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/tree/master/src/main/resources/assets/wurst/lang) and work the same as in other Minecraft mods.

Names of features (hacks/commands/etc.) should always be kept in English. This ensures that everyone can use the same commands, keybinds, etc. regardless of their language setting. It also makes it easier to communicate with someone who uses Wurst in a different language.

For discussion about translations, see [Issue #404](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/404) here or [#wurst-translations](https://chat.wurstimperium.net/channel/wurst-translations) on our RocketChat server.

## Note about Pull Requests

If you are contributing multiple unrelated features, please create a separate pull request for each feature. Squeezing everything into one giant pull request makes it very difficult for us to add your features, as we have to test, validate and add them one by one.

Thank you for your understanding - and thanks again for taking the time to contribute!!
