/**
 * <h1>Implementation notes</h1>
 *
 * <p>
 * When a client test is running, ticks are run in a much more controlled way
 * than in vanilla. A tick is split into 4
 * phases:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@linkplain #PHASE_TICK} - The client and server threads run a single
 * tick in parallel, if they exist. The test thread waits.</li>
 * <li>{@linkplain #PHASE_SERVER_TASKS} - The server runs its task queue, if the
 * server exists. The other threads wait.</li>
 * <li>{@linkplain #PHASE_CLIENT_TASKS} - The client runs its task queue, if the
 * client exists. The other threads wait.</li>
 * <li>{@linkplain #PHASE_TEST} - The test thread runs test code while the
 * client and server threads wait for tasks to be handed off.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * In {@code PHASE_TEST}, the client and server threads (if they exist) are
 * blocked on semaphores waiting for tasks
 * to be handed to them from the test thread. When the test thread wants to send
 * one of the other threads a task to run,
 * it sets {@linkplain #taskToRun} to the task runnable and releases the
 * semaphore of the thread that should run the
 * task. It then blocks on its own semaphore until the task is complete, at
 * which point the thread which completed the
 * task will release the test thread semaphore and re-block on its own semaphore
 * again and the cycle continues. When the
 * test phase is over (i.e. when the test thread wants to wait a tick), the
 * client and server semaphores will be
 * released while leaving {@linkplain #taskToRun} as {@code null}, which they
 * will interpret to mean they are to
 * continue into {@linkplain #PHASE_TICK}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The reason these phases were chosen are to make client-server interaction in
 * singleplayer as consistent as
 * possible. The task queues are when most packets are handled, and without them
 * being run in sequence it would be
 * unspecified whether a packet would be handled on the current tick until the
 * next one. The server task queue is before
 * the client so that changes on the server appear on the client more readily.
 * The test phase is run after the task
 * queues rather than at the end of the physical tick (i.e.
 * {@code MinecraftClient}'s and {@code MinecraftServer}'s
 * {@code tick} methods), for no particular reason other than to avoid needing a
 * 5th phase, and having a power of 2
 * number of phases is convenient when using {@linkplain Phaser}, as it doesn't
 * break when the phase counter overflows.
 *
 * <p>
 * Other challenges include that a client or server can be started during
 * {@linkplain #PHASE_TEST} but haven't
 * reached their semaphore code yet meaning they are unable to accept tasks.
 * This is solved by setting a flag to true
 * when the client/server is ready to accept tasks. Also the client will block
 * on the integrated server starting and
 * stopping. This is solved by first deferring those operations until
 * {@linkplain #PHASE_TICK} if they are being run
 * inside a test phase task (which is a minor difference from vanilla), and then
 * ensuring the client is still running
 * the phase logic and is able to accept tasks while it is waiting for the
 * server.
