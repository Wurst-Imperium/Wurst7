# Code of Conduct

- Try your best to be respectful and composed. Be constructive with your criticisms, and don't intentionally upset people. When providing negative feedback, attack concepts rather than people. Detailed opinions and reasoning is good, "[project] bad/cursed" is not.

- If you're getting heated and your discussions are becoming unproductive, consider stepping away from the conversation until you feel better and can think more clearly.

- Remember that everyone has a life as interesting, rich and varied as your own, and these experiences will shape everyone differently. If someone asks you to stop behaving in a certain way, you should listen to them (especially if it directly involves them).

- Don't be afraid to help out if you see someone in need of support. We were all beginners at some point, and everyone benefits from working together on problems.

- All voices are welcome, regardless of age, background, or level of experience. Try to be helpful and encouraging towards newcomers and those that need help, and don't make fun of them for knowing less than you do.

- Avoid being disruptive - don't dump memes or complaints without relevance to the topic at hand, and don't try to interrupt discussions or force them onto another topic.

- Don't ask to ask, just ask! Instead of asking for someone to help, state your problem directly. This makes it more likely for people to engage in conversation and try to help you. See: https://solhsa.com/dontask.html
