<!--NOTE: If you are contributing multiple unrelated features, please create a separate pull request for each feature. Squeezing everything into one giant pull request makes it very difficult for me to add your features, as I have to test, validate and add them one by one. Thank you for your understanding - and thanks again for taking the time to contribute!!-->
