# Experimental workflow to automate updating to a new Minecraft snapshot.

# Currently this is very similar to the semi-automatic scripts I already use,
# but moving them to GitHub Actions means I don't have to be around to start
# them. This should allow for further automation in the future.

# TODO:
# - Add more thorough automated testing where it runs the game, creates a test
#   world and takes screenshots, similar to what Fabric API does in their
#   GitHub Actions workflow.
# - Set up a server to trigger this workflow when a new snapshot is out and
#   Fabric has updated to it. This might end up running twice per snapshot,
#   because there is no way to know ahead of time if the previous Fabric API
#   build still works or if we have to wait for a new build made specifically
#   for the new snapshot.
# - Add a step to automatically release the new snapshot build if all tests
#   have passed. This will only ever run on small snapshots that don't break
#   anything, but should save a ton of time at the end of each snapshot cycle
#   when Mojang is spamming tiny pre-releases every day.

# In case it isn't obvious, these todos are very ambitious and might not end
# up working as planned.
